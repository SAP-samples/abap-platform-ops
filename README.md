# ABAP Platform Operations Reference Scenarios

## Description
The reference scenarios for ABAP Platform operations provide sample implementations of operations-related development objects. Use cases of these development objects include creating and collecting custom health metrics for monitoring using the generic simple metric framework. For more information about developing custom health metrics, see [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/developing-metrics-for-health-monitoring).

## ABAP Platform Cloud
The sample code can be found in the [ABAP-platform-cloud branch](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-ops/tree/ABAP-platform-cloud) and is intended for use in the ABAP environment in SAP BTP or SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition.
To import the reference scenario into your ABAP environment, follow the steps in the [READ-ME](../ABAP-platform-cloud/README.md) file of the branch <em>ABAP-platform-cloud</em> and download the sources from this branch.
